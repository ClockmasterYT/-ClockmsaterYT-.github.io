		<p><li><a href="http://www.evil.com">Evil.com</a> - This site has not been updated in over a year, but you can still go through it and get some laughs. <b>But don't tell anyone else it exists.</b></p>
		<p><li><a href="http://www.omegamagazine.wordpress.com">Omega Magazine</a> - This site has also not been updated in over a year. But we might come back to it soon! Maybe. Who knows?</p>
		<p><li><a href="http://www.libertariananalysis.wordpress.com">Libertarian Analysis</a> - Do you want actually thoughtful news analysis? Probably not, considering where you are right now. But just in case, this is another website run by me. Check it out if you want real opinions (don't do it).</p>

	<p>Okay, I changed my mind. If you <i>really</i> want to get in contact with me, I guess you can do it over Twitter. My handle is @&#9894;&#9742;&#9749;&#9769;&#9878;&#9876;&#9918;&#9945;. Please don't spam...</p>

	<h2>My Contact Info</h2>
	<p>I have no idea why you could possible want to talk to me purely based on this website. Maybe you're just curious and carelessly clicking links? If it's the latter: stop. You're wasting bandwidth... or something... You're definitely wasting something; I'm just not entirely sure what it is.</p>
	<p>Anyway, if you really want to talk to me for some reason, my email address is whatthehellkevin@whatthehell.com</p>
	<p>That's the only way to reach me. And if you get one of those cool Mailer Daemon Failed messages back, don't worry. The error was probably caused by how much bandwidth you wasted by randomly clicking links. All you have to do is shut off your computer, bathe in the sweat of five healthy young boys, turn your computer back on, and try again. If it still doesn't work, you did something wrong, so try again. It's <i>definitely</i> your fault, because I <i>definitely</i> didn't give you a fake email address. Swearsies.</p>

	<p>See? I told you you shouldn't mind this. I had to put another article here so the aside on the right wouldn't stretch down into the footer. That would look really fucking ugly, and we don't let our shit look fugly here at What The Hell.me. So, here's a pointless article to ensure we don't look fugly.</p>
