    <h2>NFL Draft 2019</h2>
    <timestamp>Wednesday, April 24, 2019</timestamp>
    <p>The NFL Draft is tomorrow. Can't you feel it in the air? It's a certain smell. It's either the excitement of the draft or the thick odor of public urination and drunkenness. Who can say which it is? Both are incredibly common in Nashville, I've been told.</p>
    <p>Yes, I hate Tennessee. I'm gonna find some way to ban every Tennessee I.P. address from this website. I'll figure it out. Starting in Nashville, ending in Memphis, and moving in no particular order in between.</p>

	<h2>The AAF, Part 2: It's Over</h2>
	<timestamp>Tuesday, April 9, 2019</timestamp>
	<p>Pack it all up, y'all, the AAF is done. Tom Dundon (that sumbitch) pulled himself and his $250 million investment out of the league, and now it's all over. Football operations are suspended, and the whole organization is screwed. Players are getting kicked out of their hotel rooms and being forced to foot the bill, they're having to pay their own way back to their hometowns, and their contracts are cancelled. This is one giant clusterfuck made out of a league we once thought had tremendous staying power.</p>
	<p>Honestly, I thought this one would be different. The AAF had the approval of the NFL. The games were being broadcast on the NFL Network, for crying out loud! They had big football names like Steve Spurrier and Johnny Manziel in their ranks! I honestly thought the AAF might become an official minor league for the NFL. But I guess there's no hope for that anymore.</p>
	<p>WE HAVE BEEN HOODWINKED, BAMBOOZLED, LED ASTRAY, RUN AMOK, AND FLAT OUT <i><b>DECEIVED</b></i>!!!</p>
	<p>Press "F" to pay respects, y'all.</p>

    <h2>The AAF</h2>
    <timestamp>Monday, March 5, 2019</timestamp>
    <p>Y'all, let's talk about the AAF. The Alliance of American Football.</p>
    <p>For the uninitiated, it's a spring developmental football league. All the players are NFL washouts and undrafted college players. There are no kickoffs, the team just starts on the 25-yard line. When you score a touchdown, you can't go for a PAT, you have to go for a 2-point conversion.</p>
    <p>And man alive, it is good! All the players are trying their hardest, because they all have something to prove. They all want to redeem themselves and try to claw their way back into the NFL, or for the undrafted, prove that they belong there in the first place.</p>
    <p>There's a team in Orlando. Since I'm a Jaguars fan, you can reasonably assume I'm an Orlando fan in the AAF. The Orlando Apollos. They are good! If you haven't already, check out the AAF. Become a fan. Join the cult. You will soon find out just how good those Orlando Apollos are (still undefeated, baby!). It's being broadcast on national cable networks like CBS Sports and NFL Network.</p>
    <p><i>This is a paid product placement by the AAF</i><p style="font-size: 8pt">but not really</p></p>

    <h2>LeBron the Hypocrite</h2>
    <timestamp>Wednesday, February 27, 2019</timestamp>
    <p>Ha-ha! Lebron James called out his teammates and said they weren't focused, weren't experienced enough, and weren't &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; (whatever the hell that means).</p>
    <p>Then this video comes out of him literally just standing there while guys score on him. What an asshole.</p>

    <h2>Kyler Murray</h2>
    <timestamp>Thursday, February 21, 2019</timestamp>
    <p>Kyler Murray has an extraordinary amount of power. He's flexing all over the whole rest of the world, and nobody can stop him. He can do whatever the hell he wants and nobody will bat an eye.</p>
    <p>This is some terrifying shit, honestly. This guy is so athletic that a legitimate question people are asking is, &ldquo;Is this guy gonna choose to become an MLB player or an NFL player? Seeing as he can do both, which will he choose?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>What the fuck!? The majority of people are so flabby and unathletic they have no chance of getting into either league. Hell, even some of the most athletic guys in America will never see an NFL snap or an MLB at-bat. But this sumbitch is so good at everything he does that he is getting serious offers from both major sports, and he's not even sure which one to choose.</p>
    <p>It's very possible that he does know which one he'd actually prefer, and he's just playing the field. Wouldn't you do the same if you were in his position (not that anyone reading this ever will; y'all have probably spent more time watching TV today than exercising)? I know I would (not that I'll ever be in this position either. I just jumped in the air and my belly hasn't stopped jiggling yet).</p>
    <p>He can probably make these two organizations his bitch, because they both want him desperately. He has a chance to be a generational talent in whichever sport he chooses. Nobody wants to pass that up. He could probably become the most-paid baseball player and the second most-paid football player (nobody will beat the Almighty Mahomes) if he wanted. And you'd best believe he'll make that happen.</p>
    <p>Hell, I want him. I'm a Jaguars fan. Please join us, Kyler! <b>JOIN US AND TOGETHER, WE WILL RULE THE NFL!</b></p>
    <p>Or, based on our draft history, you'll probably become a bust for no reason other than the fact that we chose you.</p>

    <h2>Welcome to the new page</h2>
    <timestamp>Thursday, February 21, 2019</timestamp>
    <p>After hours of soul-sucking labor and coding, the new sports page is finally in.</p>
    <p>And by that, I mean that after about 2 minutes of copying and pasting and slightly updating the website's style code, the new page is ready way faster than I thought it would be.</p>
    <p>Boy, I sure am lucky that this whole website uses basically the same code across the whole website. I mean, nothing changes except the middle ~66% of the page. Does that make me a lazy programmer? Am I a <i>bad programmer</i>?</p>
    <p>Fuck no! I'm just not a graphic designer, and I don't like to make things more complicated than they have to be. Carry on. Enjoy the new sports page, everybody.</p>
