    <h2>Kyler Murray</h2>
    <timestamp>Thursday, February 21, 2019</timestamp>
    <p>Kyler Murray has an extraordinary amount of power. He's flexing all over the whole rest of the world, and nobody can stop him. He can do whatever the hell he wants and nobody will bat an eye.</p>
    <p>This is some terrifying shit, honestly. This guy is so athletic that a legitimate question people are asking is, &ldquo;Is this guy gonna choose to become an MLB player or an NFL player? Seeing as he can do both, which will he choose?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>What the fuck!? The majority of people are so flabby and unathletic they have no chance of getting into either league. Hell, even some of the most athletic guys in America will never see an NFL snap or an MLB at-bat. But this sumbitch is so good at everything he does that he is getting serious offers from both major sports, and he's not even sure which one to choose.</p>
    <p>It's very possible that he does know which one he'd actually prefer, and he's just playing the field. Wouldn't you do the same if you were in his position (not that anyone reading this ever will; y'all have probably spent more time watching TV today than exercising)? I know I would (not that I'll ever be in this position either. I just jumped in the air and my belly hasn't stopped jiggling yet).</p>
    <p>He can probably make these two organizations his bitch, because they both want him desperately. He has a chance to be a generational talent in whichever sport he chooses. Nobody wants to pass that up. He could probably become the most-paid baseball player and the second most-paid football player (nobody will beat the Almighty Mahomes) if he wanted. And you'd best believe he'll make that happen.</p>
    <p>Hell, I want him. I'm a Jaguars fan. Please join us, Kyler! <b>JOIN US AND TOGETHER, WE WILL RULE THE NFL!</b></p>
    <p>Or, based on our draft history, you'll probably become a bust for no reason other than the fact that we chose you.</p>

    <h2>Welcome to the new page</h2>
    <timestamp>Thursday, February 21, 2019</timestamp>
    <p>After hours of soul-sucking labor and coding, the new sports page is finally in.</p>
    <p>And by that, I mean that after about 2 minutes of copying and pasting and slightly updating the website's style code, the new page is ready way faster than I thought it would be.</p>
    <p>Boy, I sure am lucky that this whole website uses basically the same code across the whole website. I mean, nothing changes except the middle ~66% of the page. Does that make me a lazy programmer? Am I a <i>bad programmer</i>?</p>
    <p>Fuck no! I'm just not a graphic designer, and I don't like to make things more complicated than they have to be. Carry on. Enjoy the new sports page, everybody.</p>
