	<ul>
		<p><li><a href="http://www.evil.com">Evil.com</a> - This site has not been updated in over a year, but you can still go through it and get some laughs. <b>But don't tell anyone else it exists.</b></p>
		<p><li><a href="http://www.omegamagazine.wordpress.com">Omega Magazine</a> - This site has also not been updated in over a year. But we might come back to it soon! Maybe. Who knows?</p>
		<p><li><a href="http://www.libertariananalysis.wordpress.com">Libertarian Analysis</a> - Do you want actually thoughtful news analysis? Probably not, considering where you are right now. But just in case, this is another website run by me. Check it out if you want real opinions (don't do it).</p>

	<h2>Multiple Pages</h2>
	<p>Multiple pages are up and running. Check it out!</p>
	<p><b>HOME:</b> This is where the main magic will happen. We'll post random satire, jokes, and updates here all the time. Probably multiple times per week, because we like to be funny multiple times per week. Being funny is great. If you're not funny, you're boring. Stop being boring.</p>
	<p><b>NEWS:</b> That's the page you're on right now! Here, we'll post about plans for the future and about updates to the site beyond normal posts. This page will probably stay the same most of the time because the general layout of the site probably won't change that much. You're here for the humor, right? Not layout changes? If you come to this website to see how the layout has changed, you're probably both a dork and boring. <b> STOP BEING BORING</b>.</p>
	<p><b>CONTACT:</b> This is the page you'll go to if you want to get in contact with me for... some reason...? Really, I have no idea why you'd want to contact me anyway. You will find the only email you can use to contact me, which is <i>definitely</i> not fake. You will <i>definitely</i> send a real email if you send something there.</p>
	<p><b>POLITICS:</b> We at What The Hell.me have opinions. Strong opinions. That's why on this page, we'll grace you with our news analysis and political humor. In classic What The Hell.me style, don't expect any of it to be thoughtful, classy, or make any sense.</p>

	<h2>What the Hell do you expect?</h2>
	<p>Honestly, what are you even doing here? Obviously the big news right now is that this website even fucking exists. Yep, that's the biggest thing going on right now. What are you expecting? The cure to cancer? An announcement that we're starting a subscription plan? An apology for watching you through the window when you get undressed at night? Hell no! We just started! That's the biggest news.</p>
	<p>Get lost, and wait for something to actually happen, you ungrateful, impatient retards!</p>
