What The Hell.me

WhatTheHell.me is a hilarious satire website that I'll be updating like a blog while I also do random experiments and tests while learning HTML and CSS.

Follow me if you want to be involved in some sort of weird niche, cult thing or whatever. You'll be in good company.

WhatTheHell.me is currently closed to contributions of any sort. This may change at some point, but not any time soon.
