	<h2>The British Monarchy is useless</h2>
	<timestamp>Friday, June 1, 2018</timestamp>
	<p>In the post before last, I explained why no real patriotic American should give two fucks about the royal wedding. But today, I'm going to take it a step further. Not only should nobody care about the royal wedding, but there shouldn't have been a royal wedding at all! The British Monarchy should be totally abolished, because it's totally useless.</p>
	<p>For those who haven't realized it yet, the position of a monarch is a solely ceremonial one. Sure, they have power, but it's only for deciding mundane shit, like which royal guard is gonna take the royal trash out tonight. On all actual important matters, they have to do what the Prime Minister tells them to (By the way, the Prime Minister is basically the U.K.'s version of the president. I know, right? Just call it a president, you fucking pansies!). Queen Elizabeth is basically Theresa May's bitch. The queen does whatever the Prime Minister tells her to do; it's just adding another step in the process.</p>
	<p>So let's compare it to America. Imagine if instead of President Trump signing off on a bill, he had to hand it to King Michael Jordan and say, <q>Hey, I strongly urge you to sign this bill. Legally speaking, I have no power here except to give you <q>advice.</q> But technically you're the one who has no power, so sign this goddamned bill or I'll eat your family and destroy your position, robbing your family of millions of dollars to spend each year.</q></p>
	<p>Oh yeah, and that's another thing. Not only is the Queen <i>useless</i>, but the U.K. has to pay out the ass to even have her and her family as royalty. Sure, the royal family causes some people to visit the U.K., which develops their tourism industry and gives them money from tourists, but they don't make up what they lose by having a royal family with what they make from tourism. Not even close. Some estimates put the number at $468 million lost each year to have a royal family. In fact, Queen Elizabeth is the most expensive monarch in Europe. She's spending money and she doesn't even do anything!</p>
	<p>So yes, in conclusion, I want the queen's job. I know at the beginning I said the position should be abolished, but while I was doing research for this post, I realized there are a lot of perks that come with the job. People love you, you get to spend millions of dollars on pampering yourself and just claim you're <q>boosting tourism,</q> and a whole bunch of wonderful stuff.</p>
	<p>And above all, I don't even have to do anything except exactly what the Prime Minister tells me to do! It's basically my dream job! Where do I sign up?</p>
	<p>Oh wait, it's bloodline. Quick, somebody help me come up with a scheme to insert myself into the royal family and act like I was always there!</p>

	<h2>Who cares about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle?</h2>
	<p>I want to know. Who gives two fucks about Prince Harry and the woman he's marrying? I don't know why you'd care about anyone who was getting married. Seriously, respect their privacy.</p>
	<p>But most important of all, why do you care about some prince in England? In case y'all forgot, this is <b><i>AMERICA</i></b>. This isn't England. We hate England! England's a bunch of fucking pansies who run around playing soccer and calling it football! That's not football! Football is played with a football, has endzones and uprights, and is <b><i>AMERICAN</i></b>! What you're playing is soccer, ya dolts!</p>
	<p>Got a little off track there. But no matter! We shouldn't care what they're doing in England. They suck in England. Ever since we declared independence from them in 1976 and fought the Revolutionary War in 2003, England has been our worst rival. Their princes don't deserve our attention. Nothing deserves your attention unless it's red white and blue or has an eagle on it.</p>

	<p>There. That's an eagle. Now you can pay attention to our website. God Bless America.</p>

	<h2>Salmonella is Destroying America</h2>
	<p>There is a sickening disease spreading across America, and it's not Communism. Well, Communism is a sickening disease, but it's not the exact sickening disease that I'm referring to at this moment. Anyway, the sickening disease is <b><i>SALMONELLA</i></b>! That's right, hide yo wife, hide yo kids, 'cause Salmonella is going to end us all!</p>
	<p>Now, the mainstream media (those bastards) have taken to blaming Rose Acre Farms for our dilemma with infected eggs, but I call <i>bullshit</i>! How the hell do you expect a single farm to poison the entire country? You can't! A single farm might infect ten people, but there's no way in hell they could give Salmonella to everyone. You know what I think? There's a conspiracy going on. There's always a conspiracy.</p>
	<p>Here, let me explain to you what's really going on: the U.S. government is trying to kill off the weak. That's right, the government has decided there are too many people in this country, and they want to kill off the weaklings. George Perdue III, the Secretary of Agriculture, had a secret meeting in March with all the commercial farmers in the U.S. and explained to them the overcrowding crisis. He convinced them all to purposefully infect their own eggs with Salmonella before shipping them off; that way, the weaklings would be infected and then <i>die</i>. This is their plan, people. The Purge has come, and the U.S. government is the one killing everyone.</p>
	<p>It's a conspiracy, I tell you! And I'm blowing this shit wide open! This goes beyond a single fucking farm; it goes all the way up to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Illuminati. That's right: George Perdue III is an executive in the Illuminati. That's where he's getting his orders. You heard it here first, folks.</p>
