	<h2>Who cares about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle?</h2>
	<p>I want to know. Who gives two fucks about Prince Harry and the woman he's marrying? I don't know why you'd care about anyone who was getting married. Seriously, respect their privacy.</p>
	<p>But most important of all, why do you care about some prince in England? In case y'all forgot, this is <b><i>AMERICA</i></b>. This isn't England. We hate England! England's a bunch of fucking pansies who run around playing soccer and calling it football! That's not football! Football is played with a football, has endzones and uprights, and is <b><i>AMERICAN</i></b>! What you're playing is soccer, ya dolts!</p>
	<p>Got a little off track there. But no matter! We shouldn't care what they're doing in England. They suck in England. Ever since we declared independence from them in 1976 and fought the Revolutionary War in 2003, England has been our worst rival. Their princes don't deserve our attention. Nothing deserves your attention unless it's red white and blue or has an eagle on it.</p>

	<p>There. That's an eagle. Now you can pay attention to our website. God Bless America.</p>

	<h2>Salmonella is Destroying America</h2>
	<p>There is a sickening disease spreading across America, and it's not Communism. Well, Communism is a sickening disease, but it's not the exact sickening disease that I'm referring to at this moment. Anyway, the sickening disease is <b><i>SALMONELLA</i></b>! That's right, hide yo wife, hide yo kids, 'cause Salmonella is going to end us all!</p>
	<p>Now, the mainstream media (those bastards) have taken to blaming Rose Acre Farms for our dilemma with infected eggs, but I call <i>bullshit</i>! How the hell do you expect a single farm to poison the entire country? You can't! A single farm might infect ten people, but there's no way in hell they could give Salmonella to everyone. You know what I think? There's a conspiracy going on. There's always a conspiracy.</p>
	<p>Here, let me explain to you what's really going on: the U.S. government is trying to kill off the weak. That's right, the government has decided there are too many people in this country, and they want to kill off the weaklings. George Perdue III, the Secretary of Agriculture, had a secret meeting in March with all the commercial farmers in the U.S. and explained to them the overcrowding crisis. He convinced them all to purposefully infect their own eggs with Salmonella before shipping them off; that way, the weaklings would be infected and then <i>die</i>. This is their plan, people. The Purge has come, and the U.S. government is the one killing everyone.</p>
	<p>It's a conspiracy, I tell you! And I'm blowing this shit wide open! This goes beyond a single fucking farm; it goes all the way up to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Illuminati. That's right: George Perdue III is an executive in the Illuminati. That's where he's getting his orders. You heard it here first, folks.</p>
