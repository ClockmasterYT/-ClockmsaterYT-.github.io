    <h2>Fuck smoke alarms</h2>
    <timestamp>Friday, February 8, 2019</timestamp>
    <p>You know what? Fuck smoke alarms. Every ounce of my being at the moment is devoted to hating smoke alarms and finding some way to make them unconstitutional.</p>
    <p>I'm becoming increasingly convinced that the damned things don't do jack shit. Well, except wake me up in the middle of the night and send my dogs scurrying around the house in terror. That is all they do.</p>
    <p>Let me tell you something. In the last 12 hours, my smoke alarms have gone off four times. My house as gone up in flames exactly zero times. I feel like these little plastic pieces of ass nuggets are missing the point of their existence.</p>
    <p>The one thing a smoke alarm is supposed to do is tell me when something is on fire. Maybe it should do a nice little chirp every couple of hours to tell me when the batteries are out of juice. But for any other reason, I should hear no beeping! Instead, I hear beeping all the live long day for no discernable reason whatsoever. I've changed the batteries, I've hit the reset button... Nothing works! Nothing has ever been on fire in my house, and yet I've lost count of how many times my stupid fucking smoke alarms have gone off.</p>
    <p>It wouldn't be a problem if the sound wasn't such an ear-splitting, migraine-inducing cacophany of terror. It would be completely fine if the noise was just somewhat annoying. A small, insignificant reminder that it was there.</p>
    <p>But no! The beep that emits from these tools of Satan is designed to wake people up from deep sleep, so they make it <b>LOUD</b>. Your average smoke alarm is designed to be 85 decibels from about 10 feet away. That's the same decibel level as a screaming baby or a lawn mower. Plus, they make its shriek basically as high-pitched as the human ear can perceive, so one blast could easily give you a severe headache.</p>
    <p>All this, and the damned things don't even work correctly. Could somebody remind the manufacturers of smoke detectors that they're supposed to go off when there's <b>FIRE</b>? They are <b>NOT</b> supposed to go off every time President Trump tweets, Adam Levine removes his shirt, or someone remembers something embarrassing they did 10 years ago. Because right now, that's how often it seems to go off.</p>
    <p>The first smoke alarm was invented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton. Rest assured, Mr. Upton is surely buring in Hell at this very moment for the crimes he's committed against humanity. And if there's any justice in this world, Hell is filled with smoke alarms.</p>

    <p>Sorry for the watermark, but I couldn't find this image without one, and it just fits too well.</p>

	<h2>On Shakespeare</h2>
	<timestamp>Monday, November 12, 2018</timestamp>
	<p>I have some legitimate grievances about William Shakespeare and his works that I'd like to air right now.</p>
	<p>The man had zero creativity with the names of his plays. Half the time, he literally just named it after the person on the play who died. Think about it: <i>Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, Julius Caesar</i>... That's the stupidest thing a writer could do. Trust me; I <b>am</b> a writer. If I just named each of my stories after whoever died in it, my Creative Writing teacher would wring my damn neck. She'd also do that if she knew I was doing this instead of her homework, but that's not important.</p>
	<p>Here's something else: the names of the people in his plays are the fucking worst. The only times he ever got it right were in <i>Macbeth</i> and in <i>Julius Caesar</i>. And it's pretty hard to fuck up the names in those plays. <i>Macbeth</i>, for example, took place in Scotland, which was just 200 miles away from where he lived, so the names wouldn't have been too hard to come up with. It's like someone in Orlando trying to come up with a name for someone from Miami. Not that hard. Julius Caesar, was a real person of course, and so were the other people in the play. I think they were real... Even if they aren't you can't tell me, because I was smart and didn't program a comments section. <b>AND I NEVER WILL</b>. In any case, look at <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. I assume he just made up weird-ass names like "Mercutio" and "Montague" and "Capulet" and "Tybalt" because he didn't know any real Italian names.</p>
	<p>And finally (at least for now)... "Macbeth" is a terrible name. This kind of ties in with the last point. "Macbeth" sounds like what would happen if McDonald's started making burgers out of the flesh of socialite prom queens. I'll leave it at that.</p>

	<h2>About Bandwagon Fans</h2>
	<timestamp>Saturday, November 10, 2018</timestamp>
	<p>Let me make something perfectly clear.</p>
	<p>There are three NFL teams that have rules about who is and isn't allowed to be a fan. The teams themselves did not make these rules, but they're unspoken rules that need to finally by spoken.</p>
	<p>Those three teams are the New England Patriots, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Green Bay Packers. You are only allowed to like the Patriots if you live somewhere in New England. To be a little more specific, you may only be a Patriots fan if you live in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, or Rhode Island, or spent a significant portion of your life in one of those states. If that doesn't apply to you and you like the Patriots, <b>YOU ARE A FILTHY BANDWAGON FAN.</b></p>
	<p>You are only allowed to like the Pittsburgh Steelers if you live in Pennsylvania (excluding Philadelphia), or you spent a significant portion of your life in Pennsylvania (excluding Philadelphia). If those don't apply to you and you like the Pittsburgh Steelers, <b>YOU ARE A FILTHY BANDWAGON FAN.</b></p>
	<p>You are only allowed to like the Green Bay Packers if you live in Wisconsin or spent a significant portion of your life in Wisconsin. If that doesn't apply to you and yet you still choose to cheer for those god-awful cheese men, <b>YOU ARE A FILTHY BANDWAGON FAN.</b></p>
	<p>Any other team is fair game. You can live in Miami and still support the Seattle Seahawks for all I care. There's no rule against that. But if you're going to call yourself a fan of one of those three bandwagon teams, you better have a damn good reason for it. And even if you do have a good reason, I <i>highly</i> urge you to reconsider. Rooting for one of those three teams is basically a one-way ticket straight to Hell. That is, if there's even an afterlife for people like you.</p>

	<h2>Linux, y'all</h2>
	<timestamp>Friday, November 9, 2018</timestamp>
	<p>I just recently made the switch from Windows to Linux. After hearing many arguments for and against the change, I decided to just go through with it. I downloaded Linux Mint on my laptop, and I haven't  looked back since.</p>
	<p>Well, I can't look back, actually. I had to delete Windows to get Linux, because my laptop's hard drive doesn't have enough storage to dual boot, unfortunately. But it's fine! This is all fine! Although, I do miss it sometimes...</p>
	<p>In any case, expect a manifesto for Linux soon. I'm putting a draft together, and I swear it's going to convince you all to switch from Windows. Or Mac, if you're a fucking plebian clod who shells out thousands of dollars for an inferior product so you can have a logo on the back of your computer.</p>
	<p>Honestly, there is so much stuff I could say about Macintosh. I'm not exaggerating when I say that Mac is literally one of the worst things ever. And if you're one of the dumb <s>fuckers</s> suckers who uses it, you're not far behind.</p>
	<p>Do you realize that you're being conned by the ghost of Steve Jobs and his posse of wannabe entrepreneurs? Macintosh computers are, objectively, inferior products. The build quality is appallingly awful, the GUI is infuriatingly basic, and they all but require you to use their lame software. And all the while, you're paying out the ass for it when you could pay half the price for a PC that's three times as good.</p>
	<p>I could go on and on about this. And you know what? I will. But not right now. I'll save it for a later post. Now you can expect a manifesto on why you should use Linux and why Mac should be destroyed. I urge you to support me on Patreon so I can write this essay.</p>
	<p>Ah damn it. You know what? I'm not even gonna say it this time. This joke is so over-used.</p>

	<h2>Why use slurs?</h2>
	<timestamp>Friday, July 27, 2018</timestamp>
	<p>I know this comes up a lot, but I don't understand why black people call each other by the "n" word. I know about the history and the significance of the word, and I know that white people shouldn't say it, but it's alright if a black person says it. I understand all that. But it still seems weird to just casually refer to someone of your own race by a racial slur.</p>
	<p>It's just so weird. White people don't do it. Heck, nobody except blacks do it, to my knowledge. I mean, just imagine how weird it would be if the following scenario played out:</p>
	<p><b>ME:</b> Hey there, cracker! How's it going?</p>
	<p><b>THEM:</b> I'm doing real well, gringo. How about you?</p>
	<p><b>ME:</b> Oh, I'm doing fine. I was just talking to Logan, my WASP back in Florida, about some really strong coffee I just bought.</p>
	<p><b>THEM:</b> Whoa, really strong coffee? Florida? You're one crazy whitey.</p>
	<p><b>ME:</b> Not as crazy as you, honky!</p>
	<p>Rest assured, many an eyebrow would be raised.</p>

	<h2>On Elder Scrolls VI</h2>
	<timestamp>Monday, June 11, 2018</timestamp>
	<p>Elder Scrolls VI was announced yesterday at E3, along with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkFdqqyI8y4">wonderfully informative trailer</a>. Everybody on most corners of the internet is losing their collective minds wondering about the details, such as where it's going to take place, what features will they add and remove, will the story be better than Skyrim's generic shit, et cetera.</p>
	<p>Over here at What The Hell.me however, I'm wondering something very different. Why is everyone losing their minds and watching this shit? They didn't even tell anyone what it is, and the trailer itself could've been made in fucking Windows Movie Maker! It's nothing except the words <q>Elder Scrolls VI,</q> but that's enough to make everyone lose their shit. Bethesda puts zero effort into this so-called <q>trailer</q> and gets (at this time in writing) 2.7 million views on YouTube. Then look at Peanut Butter Gamer. His latest YouTube video is actually quality and has substantial content, but only has (at this time in writing) 772 thousand views.</p>
	<p>Quality content is pushed aside in the name of hype value. It's despicable! It looks like the show was about to start and they were like, <q>Oh shit, the crowd wants to see something Elder Scrolls-related! Quick, use that random stock footage we have of a fantastical land, but some Elder Scrolls music on top, and then write <q>Elder Scrolls 6</q> on top of all of it! Quick!</q> Disgusting.</p>
	<p>This hits me on a really personal level, because I just uploaded my latest video, and it has like one view. My videos are quality, but nobody watches them! What the hell!? Please, support me and watch my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTjyPz-NkbU">high-quality video</a>. Okay, this isn't my video, but it's <i>exactly</i> the right kind of quality content we should be supporting! To show your support for quality content, please donate to my Patreon.</p>
	<p>Damn it, I still don't have a Patreon! When will I stop using this joke? Never.</p>

	<h2><q>French Fries</q> is a Terrible Name</h2>
	<p>Here in America, we've come to calling it <q>french fries</q> when someone fries potatoes in oil. Those idiots across the pond call 'em <q>chips,</q> but that's a different matter for a different date.</p>
	<p>Here in the real world, where we call 'em <q>french fries,</q> I've got news for you people: you've only got one thing in that name right! Sure, they're fried, but they sure ain't French! They weren't made in France, and they weren't made by a Frenchman! They were made by Belgians in the late 17th century. If you're gonna name them after some European country, you should call them <q>Belgian Fries.</q></p>
	<p>But in this case, I think it's fitting to take a page out of the page of the Spanish language's book. In Spanish, when referring to those delicious fried potatoes, the term to use is <q>papas fritas,</q> which literally translates to <q>fried potatoes.</q> Doesn't that make so much more sense? Why name this All-American, McDonald's treat after some pansy country in Europe when you can call it what it is: fried potatoes!</p>
	<p>If anything, it least call it <q>American Fries.</q>

	<h2>Websites Suck</h2>
	<p>All websites suck balls, except for this one. You know why? They all take too damn long to load!</p>
	<p>Fuck those bastards at the fancy websites with their fancy CSS and complicated animations and shit! They think they're better than us! I don't want fancy websites and scrolling image galleries if it makes the website take a lifetime to load!</p>
	<p>I'm an important man with important places to be. I don't have time to wait days for the pages to load. Do you understand what I'm saying?</p>
	<p>Okay, here's an example. You saw how fast this page loaded, right? Now go to MSN. That page has so much complicated shit going on, it takes eons to finish loading, unless you have fancy, lightning-speed internet or something. Facebook is another website that takes way longer than it should to load. It's because it's bogged down with unnecessary graphics, bells and whistles, and...</p>
	<p><i>ahem...</i></p>
	<p>trackers.</p>
	<p>Oh yeah, and we don't have trackers on this website either. Seriously, none! Why would we need them? I don't want to fucking track you. Track yourselves! I don't have time to meticulously collect data on every corner of the internet you shit in and then use it to construct some fancy-pants formula to make money off your suffering, or whatever.</p>

	<p>In short, never go to another website. Always stay at What The Hell.me. In fact, make it your homepage so you don't even have to go anywhere else for a second.

    <p>Essentially, What The Hell.me is the best website you've ever been to. When it was still being updated, did you ever go to Evil.com? Well, this is kind of like Evil.com. Just random satire about random things. The difference is I probably won't update this daily, because I have a life, unlike those bastards at Evil.com. Also, I won't make almost every single post about President Trump, unlike those bastards at Evil.com.</p>
	<p>I'm basically just using this to learn about HTML and CSS. I want to learn how to make interesting websites that are easy to navigate and pleasing to the eye, unlike thos bastards at Evil.com. I don't know if I'll actually ever put this on the internet. If it is, then whoo! That's pretty cool! I'm paying a monthly fee to the internet gatekeepers to have this weird website up for no reason!
